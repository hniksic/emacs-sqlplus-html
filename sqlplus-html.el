;;; Commentary:

;; This package might be useful to people who use Oracle's SQL*Plus in
;; a shell buffer.  It massages the output of SQL*Plus to format it
;; into nice-looking tables a la mysql's command line client.  This is
;; feasible thanks to the fact that SQL*Plus has an option to produce
;; HTML output, and that links and w3 handle HTML tables nicely.

;; For the mode to work, you will need a working `w3' package or the
;; `links' external browser (`lynx' won't do because it doesn't handle
;; tables.)  Start the `sqlplus' client in a comint (i.e. shell)
;; buffer.  Then execute `M-x sqlplus-html-init-all', and you should
;; be set.

;; To test whether this works as intended, issue a simple query such
;; as "select 2+2 from dual".  The result should look like this:

;; SQL>select 2+2 from dual;
;;
;; +---+
;; |2+2|
;; |---|
;; | 4 |
;; +---+

;; sqlplus-html-init-all does two things: sends "set markup html on"
;; to SQL*Plus to make it write all output in HTML; and and puts the
;; buffer in sqlplus-html minor mode so that the HTML output is
;; rendered on the fly.

;; You can disable the mode at any time with `M-x sqlplus-html-mode',
;; which works as a toggle.

;; Thanks go to:
;;   * Drazen Kacar, for introducing me to "set markup html on".
